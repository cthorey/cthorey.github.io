Welcome to my webpage. 

I am Clement Thorey, a former geophysist turned data scientist looking
for complex  and challenging  problems where I  believe that  data can
make  the difference.   I finished  my PhD  in december  and I  am now
looking for  new challenge  in London.   I spent  the last  few months
learning and  playing around with  machine learning.  I guess  I write
this blog to share some of the  knowledge I am aquiring in the process
;)

I am currently  looking for job opportunities in London  where I could
use cutting  edge techniques  from the field  of machine  learning and
natural  language  processing  to  help develop  great  products  with
data. If you happen to look for somebody like me, feel free to contact
me directly ;) 

Here is my [CV](http://attachments.angel.co/624479-b87b39820dc3db3816e38ed1e986d2e0.pdf?1473158973).


# Main project 

## Geocolab 

American Geophysical  Union (AGU)  meeting is a  geoscience conference
held  every year  in December  in  San Francisco.  With nearly  24,000
attendees, AGU  Fall Meeting  is the largest  Earth and  Space science
meeting in  the world.

**Geocolab** is  a abstract-based recomendation system  I developed to
help  scientist  naviguates  through  the scientific  program  of  the
conference. It is currently live,  hosted on the heroku plaftorm, [check
it out](https://geocolab.herokuapp.com/)! I also wrote a few blog post
to detail the phase development of this project.

## PhD thesis

During  my   PhD,  I  investigated  shallow   magmatic  intrusions  on
terrestrial planets.  A magmatic intrusion is a solified rock that was
once a batch of magma that cools and solidifies within the crust.  For
instance,  the whole  Sierra Nevada  in  california is  the result  of
magmatic intrusion  accreations over a  100 millions years  time span.
Actually, most  of the  magma which  is produced  in the  Earth mantle
remains trap at depth where it cools and solifieds; volcanoes are only
a glimpse in the Earth magmatism.

Therefore, those magmatic intrusions represent  a major process in the
formation of terrestrial crust and better constraining their formation
can bring us crucial information in the understanding of terrestrial
planet formations.

presentation [here](http://www.slideshare.net/ClmentThorey/defense-upload)
