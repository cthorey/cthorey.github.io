Welcome to my webpage. 

I am Clement Thorey, a former geophysist turned machine-learning 
engineer. In the past four years, I have been leading the AI Research team at 
[xihelm](https://www.xihelm.com/) where we build robots to 
automate the process of harvesting vegetables in greenhouses thoughout 
the UK. 

I am particularly interested in the field of robotics and computer vision 
but I am always curious and eager to learn new stuff when I have the time :). 
You'll find some of the projects I have been working on in this blog.
I have also participated to a few competitions hosted by [drivendata](https://www.drivendata.org/)
where I like the focus on using ML to make the world a better place. 

Here is my [CV](https://cthorey.github.io/online-cv/).
