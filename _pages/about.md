Welcome to my webpage !

I am a former geophysicist turned machine-learning engineer. Over the past four years, I have been leading the AI Research team at xihelm where we build robots to automate the process of harvesting vegetables in greenhouses throughout the UK.

Nowadays, I am particularly interested in computer vision and reinforcement learning applied to robotics but I am always curious and eager to learn new stuff when I find the time! I usually try to turn what I learn into small projects, a non-exhaustive list can be found here. I also like to participate in competitions hosted by drivendata where I like the focus on using ML to make the world a better place.

Before that, I successfully defended a PhD in geophysics at the end of 2015. I investigated shallow magmatic intrusions and their role in the formation of the crust of terrestrial planets (Moon/Earth/Mars) using a combination of models and satellite imagery. A magmatic intrusion is a solidified rock that was once a batch of magma that cools and solidifies within the crust. Actually, most of the magma which is produced in the Earth mantle remains trapped at depth where it cools and solidifies; volcanoes are only a glimpse in the Earth's magmatism!

For more information, here is my complete [CV](https://cthorey.github.io/online-cv/).
