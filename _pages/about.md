Welcome !

I am a former geophysicist turned machine-learning engineer. Over the past four years, I have been leading the AI Research team at [Xihelm](https://www.xihelm.com) where we build robots to automate the process of harvesting vegetables in greenhouses throughout Europe.

Always looking for new opportunities to learn, I am particularly interested in the interface between computer vision and robotics. I usually try to turn what I learn into small projects, a non-exhaustive list can be found here. I also like to participate in competitions hosted by drivendata where I like the emphasis in using ML to make the world a better place.

Before that, I obtained my PhD in geophysics during which I worked on the detection of solidified magma chambers in the lunar crust through numerical simulations and data exploration.

For more information, here is my complete [CV](https://cthorey.github.io/online-cv/).
