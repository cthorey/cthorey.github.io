I"æ<p>American Geophysical  Union (AGU)  meeting is a  geoscience conference
hold  each year  around Christmas  in San  Francisco. It  represents a
great opportunity for PhD students like  me to show off their work and
enjoy what  the west coast has  to offer. However, with  nearly 24 000
attendees,  AGU Fall  Meeting  is  also the  largest  Earth and  space
science meeting  in the world.  As such, it represents  an interesting
data set to dive into the geoscience academic world.</p>
