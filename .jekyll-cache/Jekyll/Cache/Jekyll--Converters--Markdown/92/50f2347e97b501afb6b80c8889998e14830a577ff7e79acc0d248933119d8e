I"±<p>This  past week,  I  have been  working on  the  assignments from  the
Stanford                            CS                           class
<a href="http://cs231n.github.io/">CS231n: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition</a>. In
particular,  I spent  a few  hours  deriving a  correct expression  to
backpropagate          the           batchnorm          regularization
(<a href="http://cs231n.github.io/assignments2016/assignment2/">Assigment 2 - Batch Normalization</a>)
. While this post is mainly for me not to forget about what insights I
have gained  in solving this  problem, I hope  it could be  useful to
others that are struggling with back propagation.</p>
